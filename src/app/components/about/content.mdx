Hey, I'm Koen, a master at adapting to every tech challenge thrown my way. With a toolkit brimming with languages and frameworks, I've earned a rep for diving into roles with gusto and coming up sparkling. But wait, there's more to me than just bytes and bugs. I'm also a plumbing wizard, bending pipes and soldering with the precision of a craftsman.

When I'm not decoding the latest tech puzzles, you'll find me immersed in the realms of Path of Exile, unraveling the mysteries of AI, or tweaking images to perfection. Movies and globetrotting adventures? Count me in! I'm all about hard work and making every moment count - whether that's coding up a storm or, hey, even sprucing up cars and floors.

Looking ahead, my sights are set on mastering the art of tech language fluency, acing software architecture, and staying ahead of the curve with cutting-edge innovations. My mission? To craft digital beauty and functionality. So, if you're in for a journey through the world of a tech enthusiast who loves a good challenge and a bit of fun, you're in the right place!
